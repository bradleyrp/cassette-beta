CASSETTE
========

Cassette is a small case for academic documents.
More specifically, it is a lightweight code that makes it easy to 
write, share, revise, and remember your academic documents.
It is currently hosted on [github](https://github.com/bradleyrp/cassette).

Requires
--------

	1. Python version 2.7 or higher
	2. Git for tracking changes
	3. LaTeX if you want to make PDFs
	
Installation
------------

No installation is necessary, as long as you have Python and git.
If you wish to render to PDF documents, you need latex.

Run ``make demo && make`` for a demonstration, which also serves
as the documentation. Whenever you run ``make``, the compiler will
recompile any updated markdown files in the root directory.

Modifications
-------------

Send a message to [Ryan Bradley](mailto:bradleyrp@gmail.com) if
you need help implementing this code or you would like to 
add a feature.
